<p class="subtitle">Install</p>
<p>Download&nbsp;Web  AppBuilder for ArcGIS&nbsp;(Developer Edition) ZIP file to your local drive and  unzip it.</p>
<p>Since Web AppBuilder runs on top  of&nbsp;<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, it is required to have Node.js installed on your computer.  In this release, the download package contains Windows version of node.js. If you are on Windows platforms, you can go to the next step to start Web AppBuilder. If you are on the other platform, such as Mac or Linux, you should install&nbsp;<a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Node.js</a>&nbsp;specifically on your platform before the  next step.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Start Web AppBuilder</p>
<ul>
  <li>On Windows, double-click the <strong>startup.bat</strong> file inside the unzipped folder. The batch file starts the Node.js server on command prompt window, then Web AppBuilder in your default browser with <em>http://[yourmachinename]:3344/webappbuilder</em>. If the browser is closed, you can always reopen Web AppBuilder in the same or different browsers as long as Node.js is running in the command prompt window.</li>
  <li>On other platforms, open the command prompt window, navigate to the server directory of Web AppBuiilder's installation, then type&nbsp;<em>node server.js</em>. Once the Node.js runs, start Web AppBuilder in the browser with <em>http://[yourmachinename]:3344/webappbuilder</em>. If the browser is closed, you can always reopen Web AppBuilder in the same or different browsers as long as Node.js is running in the command prompt window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Web  AppBuilder runs on top of&nbsp;Node.js&nbsp;with the default port of 3344. If you want to run Web AppBuilder with additional parameters, different ports or as a Window Service , follow the instructions below. Otherwise go to next step to specify your portal URL.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run with additional parameters and different ports
    <ol>
		<li>Open a command window and navigate to the server directory of Web AppBuilder's installation.</li>
			<ul>
			  <li>On  64-bit Windows, type&nbsp;<em>node_x64.exe server.js [-port=value] [-proxy=value]</em></li>
			  <li>On  32-bit Windows, type&nbsp;<em>node_x32.exe server.js [-port=value] [-proxy=value]</em></li>
			  <li>On  other platforms, type <em>node &nbsp;server.js [-port=value] [-proxy=value]</em></li>
			 </ul>
			<p><strong>Note: </strong>-port specifies the port you want Node.js to run on and -proxy specifies the proxy URL if needed.</p>
		<li>Start Web AppBuilder in the browser with the port number specified above at <em>http://[yourmachinename]:[yourport]/webappbuilder</em>.</li>
		<p><strong>Tip: </strong>If  you have problems starting Web AppBuilder, refer to <a href="http://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/guide/faqs.htm">FAQs</a> for more information.</p>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Run as a Windows service
    <ol>
		<li>Install Node.js on your windows platform.</li>
		<li>Run Command Prompt as administrator.</li>
		<li>Navigate to the server directory of Web AppBuilder, then run <em>npm install</em> command.</li>
		<li>Run <em>npm run-script install-windows-service</em> command.</li>
		<li>Start <strong>ArcGISWebAppBuilder</strong> service from Services window.</li>
		<p>To remove <strong>ArcGISWebAppBuilder</strong>, run <em>npm run-script uninstall-windows-service</em> command.</p>
    </ol>
  </li>    
</ul>
<p class="subtitle">Specify  your portal URL</p>
<p>Specify  the URL for ArcGIS Online organization or Portal for ArcGIS that you want Web  AppBuilder to access.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Provide the AppID for Web AppBuilder</p>
<p>Since this is the first time you've used Web AppBuilder with the portal specified above, you might be asked to provide an App ID for Web AppBuilder to support OAuth2 authentication . To retrieve an App ID, manually register the Web AppBuilder in you portal and set correct redirect URIs. Refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_55703F1EE9C845C3B07BBD85221FB074">Add apps and Register your app</a> for details. When you finish the registration, copy the App ID in the text box and click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>During Web AppBuilder registration, you may input <em>http://[yourmachinename]:3344/webappbuilder</em> as URL of the app item, <em>http://[yourmachinename]</em> and <em>https://[yourmachinename]</em> as Redirect URIs. Be aware that, URIs with http and https protocols are distinguished as two different URIs. It is strongly recommended adding both of them into the URI list to avoid potential redirect issues.For a specified portal, this process is required for just once. When you start the Web AppBuilder next time, you should be able to log in the portal directly.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>An App ID is required by OAuth2 authentication. Refer to <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/">Authentication and OAuth 2</a>. If you have problems logging on, refer to <a href="http://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/guide/faqs.htm">FAQs</a> for more information.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Log in your portal</p>
<p>To use Web AppBuilder, you must have an ArcGIS Online organization account, a Portal for ArcGIS account, or a ArcGIS for Developers account. Log in with one of these accounts associated with the portal you specified above.</p>
