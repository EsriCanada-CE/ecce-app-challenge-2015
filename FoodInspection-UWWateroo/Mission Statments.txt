Mission Statement:
“Food safety: from farm to plate, make food safe” is the theme of world Health Day 2015. 
Foodborne diseases, including stomach pains, vomiting and diarrhea, have affected a 
significant number of people every year; it is estimated that about 1.5 million children are killed 
by diarrhoeal diseases annually, and most of these diseases are caused by contaminated food 
or drinking water. In addition to public health consequences, it impacts on food exports, tourism 
as well as development. Therefore, improving food safety is critical, and it requires efforts of 
both government and consumers. In Canada, restaurant and food service inspections are 
carried out to verify that safe-food-handling practices are being followed, and the inspections 
are performed at provincial governments, municipalities and regional health authorities levels. 
Consumers should also be fully informed of the results of inspections and make wise choices of 
food facilities. Public Health Inspectors check a variety of food facilities, and make the results 
available to the public on the website. To visualize the results and provide information 
interesting to the consumers, a web application is developed. Users are able to view the 
locations of food facilities on a map, and detailed information (for example, results of 
inspections, telephone number, reasons for infractions) can be displayed for user-selected points.
