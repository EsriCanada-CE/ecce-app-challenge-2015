                                 Characteristics Statement
This app is a web map service, aiming to provide food safety information for consumers to make wise 
choices of food facilities in the City of Waterloo. The map is composed of two layers, one representing 
a heatmap of critical infractions and the other containing points of food facilities. The heatmap is 
presented from red to grey based on the number of critical infractions inspected, and food facilities 
with the most number of critical infractions are shown in red while those with the least number are 
represented in grey. The two layers are illustrated on the basemap of streets by default, and the users 
can select their preferred basemaps with options of imagery, imagery with labels, streets, topographic, 
dark grey canvas, light grey canvas, oceans, terrain with labels and OpenStreetMap. Information of a 
particular food facility can be displayed once a food facility point is selected, including facility name, 
address, telephone, number of critical infractions and number of uncritical infractions. In addition, queries 
are enabled for users to extract detailed infraction information including inspection date, whether a particular 
infraction is critical and a brief description of the infraction. Users can make the queries by specifying the
 facility name or a range of dates, and inspection information of facilities with the names specified or 
inspections carried out between the dates selected will be returned to the users. Further, users can select 
facilities on the attribute table, and the selected points will be highlighted on the map. On the side of the 
web page, general information of food safety is displayed; users can find instructions on how to report food illness, 
information of food safety training courses as well as contact information of Waterloo Public Health.
