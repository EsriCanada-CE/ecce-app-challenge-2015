Skate Swim Gym Hamilton by CASMAC
==================
For the ECCE App Challenge 2015
==================



## Goals:
Make it simple to find available public recreation programs.
Display the data as a map so that users can consider arena/pool/community centre locations (i.e. geography) when deciding where to attend.
Improve the health and well-being of Hamilton-area residents.

## How to use it:
When you open SSG Hamilton, you’re greeted by a splash screen that briefly describes how the app works. The magnifying glass queries our database to find the program you want, while the signpost is what you click on to get directions. First, you’re presented with a map of Hamilton with arenas and community centres indicated by icons – a swimmer icon shows pools, a figure skate shows arenas, and a dumbbell shows gyms. The first step in using SSG Hamilton is to click on the magnifying glass. Select whether you want to skate, swim, or go to the gym. Then, from the dropdown list, select the specific skate/swim/gym program you’re interested in. Please note that a complete list of program descriptions is provided in the legend. 

The next step is to type in a day of the week that you want to go to the program. Type in “Monday,” for example, and then click Apply. The arenas that offer the program you selected on the day of the week you entered are highlight on the map, and a listing of those arenas and the times they offer the program are presented in a list. It’s up to you to figure out which time works for you. Once you’ve found an arena that works for you, click on the arena in the list and a pop-up will appear that provides the address of that rink. 

Using the ‘directions’ widget, you can enter in your home address or the address of where you will be departing from. Type the address of the arena you want to go to in the box, and then click “Get Directions.” Directions are provided for you in the pop-up window. 

## Troubleshooting
If the directions tool does not work, try adding “Ontario” to the end of your location
