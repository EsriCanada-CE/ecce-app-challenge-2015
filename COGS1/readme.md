*You can change the base map and if you want, use the map to create a web mapping application to access the selected trails from your phone!*

Happy Walking!

## Mission Statement

 Getting outdoors and exercising is more important than ever before with rising obesity and a general decrease in activity for Canadians. One of the easiest and most accessible forms of exercise is walking or hiking, all you
 need is a pair of shoes. Finding a trail to go hiking on however can be a frustrating experience. After a web search you may find a list of trails, 
 but these often have no spatial context – which trails are *CLOSE* to me, or which trails can I complete within a time frame. If you’re lucky enough
 to find a government web map with trails it often just shows the location of the trails with no connection to you in space, or no information about 
 the trail. Presently the app looks at walking trails in Surrey, British Columbia.

## What does the App do?
 **Lets Walk!** Will provide users with a complete solution to their hiking needs. It is a complete hike planning solution. The user’s location will be 
 determined by the user placing a point on a map and a series of questions will be asked: how far are you okay with driving, how much time do they have for hiking,
 what speed of hiker are you. The user will then be presented with a selection of hiking trails that meet their criteria.

## More Information
>We chose to complete this app using ArcMap and python addin, which allow us to launch the results into ArcGIS Online 
to play to our strengths of python coding. We believe that this would be an interesting app to
pursue using JavaScript and the Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS (Developer Edition) in the future.
