Description:

EPI Centered is a location-aware earthquake preparedness iPhone application for users in
Vancouver.

Use of the App:

EPICentered displays a basemap with a set of toggleable layers relevant to
a citizen in the event of an Earthquake including Hospitals, Clinics,
Community Centers, Disaster Staging Areas, Emergency Operations Centres,
Fire halls, Police Stations, and Schools.

Once the "Get Started" button is pressed, EPICentered calculates the closest
Emergency Muster location to the user from their current location based on
walking time. The user can then examine or walk this route as well as important
nearby locations in order to better understand their response to an earthquake.

Running the App in iOS Simulator:

When running EPICentered in iOS simulator select iPhone 6 as your build environment.

The user location does not always load in iOS simulator. This can be alleviated
by navigating to Debug -> Location -> then selecting "none", then going back into
the location menu and selecting a Vancouver Location.

Example:
Latitude 49.271884
Longitude -123123959

If this doesn't work, a second version of the app has been uploaded that feeds
the app a Vancouver location and generates routes from there.
