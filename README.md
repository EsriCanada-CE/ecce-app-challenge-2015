ECCE App Challenge 2015
==================

## Instructions:
These are the instructions for sharing your work on GitHub. You should create a repo here and minimally fill out a README.md [This link will show you how to create cool markdown](http://markdownlivepreview.com).  Designate someone on your team to create a repo for your project - the general flow will be to fork the "ecce-app-challenge-2015" repo to your own account, clone it in desktop, and commit and sync often.

If you are the designated person on your team, follow these steps to get ready:

* Creat a GitHub account
* Email me, [Cameron Plouffe](mailto:cplouffe@esri.ca), your GitHub username and we will add your team to the ECCE App Challenge
* [Download Windows client](https://windows.github.com), or
* [Download Mac client](https://mac.github.com)
* Open your Git client app, and set the "Clone Path" to a directory of your choice
* Fork your own copy (button in upper right of this page) of this repo to your own account
* Click the "Clone in Desktop" button, you'll see a clone of this forked repo in your Git client app
* Open up the directory on your computer where you set the clone path in the above step, you'll see a folder named "ecce-app-challenge-2015"
* Create a directory underneath this one with your team name and project - this is what will appear on GitHub
* Underneath this newly-created directory create a file called README.md, put the name of your team in there (you'll edit this over time and add more content)
* Add your project files, and do an initial commit of only the files you want to share on GitHub using your Git client
* Click the "Sync" button in your Git client
* Code away, add new files etc., and commit and sync often
* When you finished your app, and want to submit your final product, click the "Create Pull Request" button located to the left of the "Sync" button.
* For "from master into...", select "EsriCanada-CE/master". Fill out a brief (one sentence) description of your app with your team name, and then click "Send pull request".

Happy hacking,
