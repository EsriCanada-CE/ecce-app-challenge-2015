ECCE App Challenge 2015
==================

#### * Winners of the 2015 Challenge: UW_TeamSDS

## Instructions:
These are the instructions for sharing your work on GitHub. You should create a repo here and minimally fill out a README.md [This link will show you how to create cool markdown](http://markdownlivepreview.com).  Designate someone on your team to create a repo for your project - the general flow will be to fork the "ecce-app-challenge-2015" repo to your own account, clone it in desktop, and commit and sync often.

If you are the designated person on your team, follow these steps to get ready:

* Creat a GitHub account
* Email me, [Cameron Plouffe](mailto:cplouffe@esri.ca), your GitHub username and we will add your team to the ECCE App Challenge
* [Download Windows client](https://windows.github.com), or
* [Download Mac client](https://mac.github.com)
* Open your Git client app, and set the "Clone Path" to a directory of your choice
* Fork your own copy (button in upper right of this page) of this repo to your own account
* Click the "Clone in Desktop" button, you'll see a clone of this forked repo in your Git client app
* Open up the directory on your computer where you set the clone path in the above step, you'll see a folder named "ecce-app-challenge-2015"
* Create a directory underneath this one with your team name and project - this is what will appear on GitHub
* Underneath this newly-created directory create a file called README.md, put the name of your team in there (you'll edit this over time and add more content)
* Add your project files, and do an initial commit of only the files you want to share on GitHub using your Git client
* Click the "Sync" button in your Git client
* After making changes to your app, you will see an "Uncommitted changes" section visible in the Github client app. Click the "Show" dropdown button at the right of the Uncommitted changes section, type a brief summary of your changes, and then click "Commit to master"
* Code away, add new files etc., and commit and sync after every commit
* When you have finished your app and have committed/synced all changes, click the "Create Pull Request" button located to the left of the "Sync" button
* For "from master into...", select "EsriCanada-CE/master", and then click "Send pull request"

Happy hacking,
